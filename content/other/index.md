### Women in Ornithology


During my time in CISO we launched a series of six conferences in which the protagonists were the researches and the initiatives conducted by women. The initiative aimed at celebrating The International Day of Women and Girls in Science promoted by the United Nations.

The description of the initiative and the video recordings of the conferences can be found <a href="https://ciso-coi.it/en/attivita/le-donne-nellornitologia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HERE</a> (description in English, videos in Italian).
