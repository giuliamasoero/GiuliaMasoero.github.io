<!-- add a brief description of your research interests and project -->

I generally work in ecology (population dynamics, behaviour, and evolutionary ecology), with a particular interest for birds as study species. 

I am a postdoc with a Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie global fellowship for 30 months. My project will see the collaboration between the<a href="https://juliengamartin.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> M.A.D Lab</a> (Prof. Julien Martin, University of Ottawa, Canada) and the Bize Lab (Dr. Pierre Bize, Swiss Ornithological Institute - Vogelwarte, Switzerland).

My current project aims at investigating and explaining the recent changes in body size and shape of Alpine swifts (_Tachymarptis melba_) and assessing the short- and long-term effects of these changes. 

In my free time, you can find me hiking in a nice forest or up a mountain.
