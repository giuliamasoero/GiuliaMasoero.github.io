<!-- add a brief description of your research interests and project -->

I am an ecologist (population, behavioural and, recently, evolutionary ecology), with a particular interest for birds as study species. I like to answer questions related to the effects of climate change on animals using long-term individual-based datasets. Recently, I have been getting more and more interested in Open Science and Reproducibility practices.

Currently, I am a postdoc with a Marie Skłodowska-Curie global fellowship for 30 months. My project sees the collaboration between the [M.A.D. Lab](https://juliengamartin.github.io/) (Prof. Julien Martin, University of Ottawa, Canada) and the [Bize Lab](https://www.vogelwarte.ch/de/vogelwarte/ueber-uns/team/mitarbeitende/pierre-bize) (Dr. Pierre Bize, Swiss Ornithological Institute - Vogelwarte Sempach, Switzerland).

My project aims at investigating and explaining the recent changes in body size and shape of Alpine swifts (_Tachymarptis melba_) and assessing the short- and long-term effects of these changes. This project has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant agreement No 101025938, project name CLIMGROWTH.

Apart from the research work, I am (or have been) involved in the work of some Ornithological Societies, Open Science Societies and promoting women in Science. All my other activities can be found in the [Other Activities tab]({{< relref "/other/other_activities" >}}) of my website.

In my free time, you can probably find me hiking in a nice forest or up a mountain, watching birds and other animals, or relaxing in the sun while reading a book. Random news and chats on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/giumasoero) and [GitHub](https://github.com/giuliamasoero).
