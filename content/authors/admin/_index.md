<!-- add a brief description of your research interests and project -->

I am interested in ecology, behaviour, population dynamics and evolutionary ecology, with a particular love for birds as study species. 

I am a Marie Skłodowska-Curie fellow with a 2.5yr postdoc project with a collaboration between the University of Ottawa (Canada), the University of Aberdeen (UK) and the Vogelwarte (Switzerland). 

My current project aims at investigating and explaining the recent changes in body size and shape of Alpine swifts and understanding the short- and long-term effects of these changes. 

In my free time, you can find my hiking in a nice forest or up a mountain.
