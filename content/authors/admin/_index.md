<!-- add a brief description of your research interests and project -->

I am interested in ecology, behaviour, population dynamics and evolutionary ecology, with a particular love for birds as study species. 

I am a postdoc with a Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie global fellowship. My project will last 18 months and will see a collaboration among the University of Ottawa (Canada), the University of Aberdeen (UK) and the Swiss Ornithological Institute - Vogelwarte (Switzerland). 

My current project aims at investigating and explaining the recent changes in body size and shape of Alpine swifts (_Tachymarptis melba_) and assessing the short- and long-term effects of these changes. 

In my free time, you can find my hiking in a nice forest or up a mountain.
